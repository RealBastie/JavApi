CHECK:
 - java.lang.PrintStream vs. java.io.PrintStream (why lang package?)
 
To Implement:
 - java.text.MessageFormat
 - Serialism in Java format (see ... and ...)
 - XML, XPath, ...
 
Some tools are needed:

Not implemented:
 - PoRE (see later)


(1) [PoRE] Potentially release error checking tool:
    All time check before release:
    (A) all "catch (java.lang.InterruptedException e) {" need same code including 
        into "catch (System.Threading.ThreadInterruptedException e){"
    (B) Serialize check. Because Java implements serialize over interface for all
        subclasses but C# used annotations to be declared at single types.
